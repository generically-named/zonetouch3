# Zonetouch 3 Home Assistant Integration
Not actually a HA integration yet...

Currently there is only the python program that allows command line control of a ZT3. 

I am working on getting the python program to be a HA integration as the python program is fully capable of everything you'd want in a zone controller.

See the thread on HA forum for ZoneTouch3 Communication Protocol: https://community.home-assistant.io/t/zonetouch-3-by-polyaire/496405
