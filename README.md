# Zonetouch 3 Home Assistant Integration
Not actually a HA integration yet...

Currently there is only the python program that allows command line control of a ZT3. 

I am working on getting the python program to be a HA integration as the python program is fully capable of everything you'd want in a zone controller. As ChatGPT isn't being very helpful I am struggling through the docs and examples to try and figure this out...

The packets I have captured and analysed are provided in the Excel spreadsheet. I do have the packet captures themselves but am reticent to upload them all to the internet in that form... _call me paranoid_
